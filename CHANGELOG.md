# Changelog

Rebuild of the NCKH "agent for web pentest" project from the original
CTF-focused toolkit into an authorized, audit-ready web penetration-testing
system. All notable milestones on `agent-v2`.

## Rebuild milestones

### Core runtime (fail-closed by construction)
- ScopeGuard: host allowlist, private-IP and file-scheme refusal, per-hop
  redirect re-check, DNS-cache aware — refuses before any bytes are sent.
- GuardedClient: the only socket-owning client; every request is
  scope-checked, rate-limited, budgeted and transcript-recorded, including
  `send_raw` (desync probes carry operator headers but keep scoped Host).
- Evidence gate: `record_finding` requires a verbatim excerpt that is a
  substring of a cited recorded response, an in-scope URL, and dedups by
  bug class + endpoint + params.
- Tamper-evident audit: sha256 hash chain over `transcript.jsonl`, chain
  head anchored in `summary.json`; `argus verify` detects edits,
  insertions, deletions, tail truncation — and re-validates every finding
  against the immutable transcript so an edited `findings.json` fails too.
  Run end seals `meta.json`/`findings.json`/`notes.md`/`summary.json`
  sha256 digests into the chain (`artifacts_digest`), so post-run edits
  to ANY session artifact are caught; `argus report`/`argus findings`
  warn on broken chains, failing findings and seal mismatches.
- ScopeGuard exclusions match the normalized wire path: percent-encoding
  and dot-segments cannot bypass `--exclude` (httpx decodes/resolves
  before sending, so the raw-path check was fail-open).
- Operator secrets never persist: `Authorization`/`Cookie`/`Set-Cookie`/
  `X-*-Token` and any `--header`-configured value are redacted at record
  time (transcript + logs) and re-redacted at render time (old sessions);
  `--proxy` remains the wire-fidelity path. `--secret`/`ARGUS_SECRETS`
  declare credential *values* (login passwords posted in bodies, quoted
  tokens) that `Session` redacts inside every artifact write — bodies,
  event output, notes, meta.json, logs — while the model still sees the
  real bytes.

### The proof matrix (`argus/proof.py`)
- The verbatim gate proves the bytes were observed, not that the class was
  demonstrated: a benign page reading `uid=1 selected` satisfied it for a
  claimed critical RCE. Every finding is now also graded against a
  requirement written per class — 29 classes, four grades (`proven`,
  `candidate`, `unproven`, `refused`).
- Verifiers read the recorded request AND response of the cited exchanges,
  never a probe's self-report, so a probe cannot grade itself. `rce` needs
  the identity line plus a nonce and rejects an identity line that appears in
  its own request — a reflection cannot pass. `sqli` needs the engine named
  plus a row from a named table; an error string in the excerpt fails the row
  check by construction. `xss` cannot exceed `candidate` without a browser,
  and says so.
- Scanner output stopped being admissible: `run_external`/`mcp_call` record
  events with no `response`, so a claim citing only those fails the wire
  check for every class. The docs always said "a lead, not evidence";
  nothing enforced it.
- The grade never blocks the record — a candidate is worth re-testing — and
  the result names the checks that did not pass. Re-recording with the
  missing evidence **upgrades** the finding in place rather than being
  refused as a duplicate. `--require-proof` refuses anything below `proven`.
  A `refused` class (dos) cannot be recorded at all.
- `category` is an enum of the 29 classes and the dedup key is the canonical
  class, so `SQLi`, `sql-injection` and `sqlinjection` are one bug and not
  three — the cross-worker dedup the docs promised but normalized free text
  could not deliver.
- `argus proof [class]` prints a requirement; `load_skill("<class>")`
  attaches the same one to its methodology module, which is the moment it
  still changes what gets sent.
- `argus verify` recomputes every grade from the chained transcript, so a
  grade raised by hand in `findings.json` fails — including after an
  `argus report` re-render has recomputed the artifact seal, which is the
  only signal that survives that laundering.
- Graded against the old checked-in demo session: 1 proven, 2 candidate,
  2 unproven. One of the unproven was its `critical` "forged admin token
  accepted", which cited `GET /api/user/1` — a request carrying no token.

### argus as an MCP server (`argus mcp-serve`)
- `user -> LLM -> MCP -> tool`: 45 of the 55 tools served over
  newline-delimited stdio JSON-RPC, symmetric with the client in
  `argus/mcp.py`, so both halves of the protocol are testable against each
  other. Register it with any MCP host.
- The driver moves outside; the guards do not. Scope, rate limit,
  transcript, dedup and grading stay on this side, and `initialize` returns
  the operating contract as `instructions`.
- Withheld: all eight board tools (the host LLM is the orchestrator, and
  outside team mode there is no Board, so the four that were advertised could
  only raise) plus `mcp_list`/`mcp_call` (argus calling out while serving is a
  loop the operator cannot see).

### Probe coverage (27 matched-pair probes)
- Injection: sqli (quoted/numeric/OR-pair/xpath/UNION + opt-in bounded
  `extract_table` read with the LIMIT applied in the tool), nosqli, ssti,
  **cmdi** (`id; echo <nonce>` across 8 separator families, reads the output
  rather than the clock, and reports a reflection as a reflection),
  command-time, lfi, reflection/xss.
- Access: idor, user-enum (error+timing), lockout, mass-assignment.
- Transport: request-smuggling (CL.TE/TE.CL/obf raw sends), crlf,
  open-redirect (incl. javascript: scheme + httpx verbatim recovery),
  cors (5 channels incl. preflight + null origin), methods, host-header.
- Crypto/state: jwt_decode + jwt_forge (weak-secret crack → re-sign chain),
  deserialization (java/php/pickle/node/yaml/dotnet/ruby).
- Infra: ssrf (incl. file:// + ip-encodings), cache poison+deception,
  prototype-pollution (__proto__ + constructor.prototype), upload, race,
  websocket, xxe, info-disclosure, graphql-introspect, csrf.

### Multi-agent team mode
- Lead/recon/exploit/report role cards; tool subsets enforced in dispatch,
  never only in the prompt.
- Typed lead queue: recon `emit_lead`s surface while exploit workers
  `pull_leads` concurrently — streaming pipeline, not stage batching.
- Shared typed blackboard (leads/notes/requests/status/findings),
  worker-spawn requests, max_workers cap, per-role turn/request budgets.
- Crash isolation per worker, lead-death closes the pipeline, watchdog +
  bounded joins, daemon threads — the team cannot wedge.
- `mcp_call` scope-checks every http(s) URL inside its arguments — an
  MCP fetch server cannot become a path around the scope guard, and the
  block is recorded in the transcript.
- External-tool args are scanned for URLs, bare hosts, IPv6 literals
  (`nmap ::1` no longer slips past `split(':')`), single-label names
  (`localhost`, `db01`) and non-canonical IP spellings (`127.1`,
  `2130706433`, `0x7f000001`) — tools parse all of them even where the
  host resolver does not. Per-tool flag guards cover local-file exfil,
  target-list files (incl. IPv6 lines), redirect flags, and local code
  exec (ffuf `-input-cmd`, sqlmap `--eval`/`--alert`/`-z eva=`,
  nuclei `-code`/`-lfa`/custom interactsh, nuclei template dirs
  confined to cwd, ffuf `-request` files host-checked).

### LLM layer
- Auth chain: `--api-key`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`/
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` → Claude Code OAuth (auto-refresh) → OpenCode.
- Prompt caching with ephemeral breakpoints on the static prefix
  (~90% input discount); cache metrics in summary/compare.
- `--tools` allowlist for constrained OAuth tiers (validated, meta.json
  records the subset); `argus check` now diagnoses the tool-surface cap
  directly instead of letting it fail mid-run.
- Budget-aware loop: early warning at ~80% + record-immediately contract
  (measured A/B on a real run: 1 → 5 findings at equal budget).
- Context-bounded history: old tool_results compact to stubs naming their
  request_ids; `read_response` re-inspects any exchange — an 80-turn run
  cannot silently overrun the window.
- Real-LLM e2e verified over Claude Code OAuth: the evidence gate rejected
  hallucinated excerpts and malformed calls; no code path needed the
  model's word over the transcript's bytes.

### Reports & artifacts
- `argus diff <before> <after>`: retest comparison at finding level —
  FIXED / STILL PRESENT (with severity drift + id pairs in `--json`) /
  NEW, matched on class+host+path+params so fresh lab ports still line
  up; warns when either input session has unverifiable findings.
- `argus report/findings/diff` re-validate findings before trusting
  them: bad rows are excluded from renders and marked `UNVERIFIED` in
  listings; report refuses non-session and empty-transcript dirs rather
  than fabricating a verifiable "session".
- `report.md` + `report.html`: severities, CVSS, auto-mapped CWE,
  OWASP Top 10 (2021) buckets, verbatim proof, embedded transcript
  excerpts, coverage, constraints, agent metrics, notes appendix.
  Dynamic code fences mean target bytes
  cannot break out and inject fake report sections.
- `report.sarif`: SARIF 2.1.0 — findings ingestible by GitHub code
  scanning / Azure DevOps dashboards.
- `findings.json`, `notes.md`, `meta.json`, `summary.json`,
  `agent*.log`, per-session `report.*`.

### Extensibility (data, not code)
- `argus/resources/wordlists/*.txt` → `wordlist_fuzz`
  (path/param/POST-body modes).
- `argus/resources/exploits/<id>/manifest.json` → `run_exploit`
  (scope-checked, timeout-bounded, env-scrubbed, `proof_marker` verdict).
- `<cwd>/resources/wordlists/` shadows bundled lists on any install;
  `<cwd>/resources/exploits/` requires `ARGUS_EXPLOITS_CWD=1`.
- Two bundled exploits demonstrate the manifest path:
  `lab-auth-bypass`, `lab-jwt-forge`.

### Ambient-trust hardening (cwd/env are untrusted input)
- `.env` whitelists credential keys only — `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and
  `ARGUS_MCP_CONFIG` from a stray .env can no longer redirect the API
  endpoint (key exfil) or name subprocesses.
- Target client runs `trust_env=False`: env proxies and `~/.netrc`
  cannot silently re-route scoped traffic or attach Basic credentials;
  `--proxy` is the only proxy path.
- cwd `resources/exploits/` and cwd `mcp.json`/`.argus-mcp.json` are
  opt-in (`ARGUS_EXPLOITS_CWD=1`, `ARGUS_MCP_CWD=1`) — a planted
  manifest/config inside an untrusted checkout cannot execute commands
  through the model; wordlists keep unconditional shadowing.
- `--header`/`--header-file` reject control characters — a pasted CRLF
  cannot smuggle header lines onto the raw-send wire.
- Reads are memory-bounded everywhere: response bodies stream at
  BODY_CAP, subprocess stdout/stderr go through tempfiles with
  stream-searched proof markers, MCP frames cap at 4MB, wordlists and
  target files read only what is needed, persisted request bodies cap.
- Corrupt-input forensic tolerance: `verify`, `report`, `findings`,
  `diff`, `compare`, `sessions` and `--resume` degrade safely on
  malformed JSON, non-list findings, directory-swapped artifacts and
  broken meta.json — flagged as integrity signals, never tracebacks.
- MCP config errors (unreadable file, missing `command`) warn on
  stderr at run start instead of silently dropping servers.
- DNS-rebinding defense: `send()`/`send_raw()` verify the connected
  peer's real address (`network_stream.server_addr` / `getpeername`)
  and refuse private IPs when `--allow-private` was not given —
  the scope check's resolution and the socket's are separate answers.
- Boundary validation before budget: non-str/bytes bodies, non-dict
  headers and control-char methods are rejected before `sent += 1`.
- `record_event` detail values bound at 60k serialized chars each;
  LLM/gateway shapes (non-object JSON, non-str text/input/name/id,
  non-int usage counters) degrade to retries/zeros, never crashes.
- Target-controlled URLs are fuzz-safe: `crawl`, `js_recon`, `diff`,
  renderers, `_redact_url` and `_finding_key` all skip/degrade on
  `http://[bad`-class input instead of tracebacking.
- Model-supplied JSON types are coerce-hardened end to end: every tool
  param that flows through `.lower()`/`.strip()`/`int()` is str/typed
  before use, numeric clamps share `registry._ival` (wrong type falls
  back to the default instead of killing the tool call), and
  `record_finding`/`finish`/team tools gate clean on int/list input.
- Operator-input validation is fail-fast: `--proxy` scheme (incl. a
  clear socks5-needs-socksio message), `--resume` session-dir check,
  `--session-dir` not-a-file check, malformed `--mcp-config` lands
  per-server errors instead of crashing startup.

### Verification & packaging
- `python selftest.py`: 129 offline checks, including a documentation
  consistency pass — every tool, subcommand, proof class and **stated count**
  in the docs is verified against the code, and a count the docs stop stating
  fails rather than passing on nothing. It caught a stale tool-schema count
  in `docs/USAGE.md` on its first run, left behind by an earlier version.
- `python -m pytest tests/ -q`: 326 tests (unit + live-lab + loop +
  team + MCP client + MCP server + proof matrix + CLI + external-tool
  subprocess path + hardening regressions).
- The proof matrix is tested in both directions per class: an evidence set
  that must grade `proven`, and one that must not. The second is the one that
  matters, and `test_every_class_refuses_a_benign_page` runs all 29 against a
  page with no bug in it. Four defects were found that way — three checks
  that passed without the claimant doing anything class-specific, and a
  relative `Location: /home` read as the host `home`.
- Fault-tolerance pass: every forensic reader (`verify`, `findings`,
  `diff`, `sessions`, `_reopen`, renderers) degrades malformed session
  artifacts to flags/warnings instead of tracebacks — fuzzed across
  dir-swaps, non-dict JSON, null fields and truncated files; locked in
  by `test_readers_survive_mutated_session_dir`. `dispatch` itself is
  total (every tool × wrong-JSON-type args returns a serializable
  dict) under `test_dispatch_total_on_malformed_args`.
- `python -m argus demo` / `demo --team`: scripted end-to-end on the lab,
  no API key. Six findings each, five graded `proven` and one honest
  `candidate`, and both acceptance criteria are demonstrated offline:
  `id` output with the probe nonce for rce, five rows from `users` for sqli.
  Both arms thread request ids out of each probe result the way a real agent
  does; a scripted demo that cites differently from a real run is not
  demonstrating the pipeline it claims to.
- `lab/vulnapp.py` `/ping` executes for real so the rce class is reachable:
  argv through a seven-command allowlist, never a shell, `cat` confined to
  the lab's fake filesystem, bound to loopback. A destructive payload returns
  `command not found`.
- Wheel ships skills + role prompts + wordlists + exploit manifests;
  CI (Ubuntu+Windows × Py3.10/3.11/3.12) runs pytest + selftest + a
  wheel-contents check.
